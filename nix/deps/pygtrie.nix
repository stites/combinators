      pygtrie is a Python library implementing a trie data structure.

      Trie data structure, also known as radix or prefix tree, is a tree associating
      keys to values where all the descendants of a node have a common prefix
      (associated with that node).

      The trie module contains Trie, CharTrie and StringTrie classes each implementing
      a mutable mapping interface, i.e. dict interface. As such, in most circumstances,
      Trie could be used as a drop-in replacement for a dict, but the prefix nature of
      the data structure is trieâ€™s real strength.

      The module also contains PrefixSet class which uses a trie to store a set of
      prefixes such that a key is contained in the set if it or its prefix is stored
      in the set.
